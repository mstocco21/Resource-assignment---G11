# fastqc G11_R1.fastq.gz
# fastqc G11_R2.fastq.gz
## Performs quality control on the files and dowloads the QC report as an html file

#cutadapt -q 20,20 -a CTGTCTCTTATACACATCTCCGAGCCCACGAGAC -A CTGTCTCTTATACACATCTGACGCTGCCGACGA -m 50 --max-n 0 -o G11_R1.cutadapt.fastq -p G11_R2.cutadapt.fastq G11_R1.fastq.gz G11_R2.fastq.gz
## Performs quality trimming on both the G11_R1 and G11_R2 fastq files and creates the trimmed files in new .cutadapt.fastq files

# fastqc G11_R1.cutadapt.fastq
# fastqc G11_R2.cutadapt.fastq
## performs quality control on the new trimmed files to assure quality trimming

# cp G11_R1_cutadapt.fastq de_novo_assemblyRP/
# cp G11_R1_cutadapt.fastq de_novo_assemblyRP/
## This command moves the cutadapt files from the previous folder into a new de_novo_assemblyRP folder directly to make room for the next
## stage of the project.

# conda activate de_novo
## activates the Spade assembly tool, this will be the assembler uses as it provides de Bruijn graph processing and contig refinement at the 
## end of the process for better reads

# spades.py -k 21,51,71,91,111,127 --careful --pe1-1 G11_R1.cutadapt.fastq --pe1-2 G11_R2.cutadapt.fastq -o G11_spades_output
## Uses spade.py to create a new assembly from the cutadapt files from scratch and puts them into a fdirectory marked "G11_spades_output"
##

# cd G11_spades_output
# quast contigs.fasta -o Quast_contigs
## changes directory to the output and uses the quast genome assesment tool to store a quality report in the directory Quast_contigs
## winSCP was used to bring up the .html document so we could assess the quality ourselves.

# cp de_novo/G11_spades_output/contigs.fasta prokka_annotation
## This command moves the cutadapt files from the previous folder into a new prokka_annotation folder directly to make room for the next
## stage of the project.

# awk '/^>/{print ">G11_" ++i; next}{print}' < contigs.fasta > contigs_names.fasta
# prokka --outdir G11 --prefix G11 contigs_names.fasta
## Use a unix filter known as awk to prepare the data for processing with prokka and then rns the prokka pipeline for annotation
